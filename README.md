## Database Structure

The system uses a MySQL database with the following main tables:
- `users`: Stores user account information
- `posts`: Contains all blog post content
- `comments`: Stores user comments on posts
- `likes`: Tracks post likes by users
- `followers`: Manages user following relationships
- `inquiry`: Stores user contact form submissions

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository to your web server directory
2. Import the SQL schema from the `SQL/tables.txt` file
3. Configure the database connection in `config/database.php`
4. Ensure your web server has PHP 7+ and MySQL installed
5. Set appropriate read/write permissions for the `uploads` directory

## System Architecture

The system follows a structured architecture:
- `config/`: Contains database connection and core functions
- `CSS/`: Stylesheets for the application
- `JavaScript/`: Client-side validation and asynchronous functionality
- `Pages/`: PHP and HTML templates for different sections
- `SQL/`: Database schema and queries
- `uploads/`: Directory for user uploaded images

## Security Implementation

### Client-side Security
- Input validation for all forms
- Password strength requirements
- XSS prevention through input sanitization

### Server-side Security
- Prepared statements for all database queries
- Password hashing for user credentials
- Session management with secure cookies
- Protection against SQL injection

## Asynchronous Functionality

The platform implements real-time updates for:
- New posts appearing on the home feed
- Comments on blog posts
- Like counts and status
- User search results

These updates occur without requiring page reloads, enhancing the user experience.

## Testing Credentials

For testing purposes, two pre-created accounts are available:
- **Admin Account**: <br> 
  -Contact Admin for info
  
- **Sample User Account**:  
  - Email: raad.sask@gmail.com 
  - Password: Raad7223


## Known Limitations

- Image uploads are limited to common formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF)
- Rich text formatting is basic
- Mobile responsiveness may have minor issues on certain devices

## Unit Tests

The application includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure code quality and functionality. Tests are organized into three categories:

### Unit Tests
- **UserTest.php**: Tests user management operations including creation, retrieval, updating, deletion, and validation of usernames, emails, and passwords.
- **PostTest.php**: Validates blog post functionality including creation, update, retrieval by various parameters, and content validation.
- **CommentTest.php**: Tests comment operations including adding comments to posts, retrieving comments, and validation.
- **LikeTest.php**: Verifies post liking functionality, including toggling likes and counting likes per post.

### Integration Tests
- **UserPostsTest.php**: Tests the relationship between users and their posts, including post creation, retrieval, and filtering.
- **PostCommentsTest.php**: Validates the interaction between posts and comments, including comment ordering and cascade deletion.
- **LikesAnalyticsTest.php**: Tests analytics related to post popularity based on like counts.

### Functional Tests
- **AuthenticationTest.php**: End-to-end tests for user authentication flows including login, registration, password validation, and session handling.
- **ContactFormTest.php**: Tests the contact form functionality including submission validation and database storage.

### Running Tests

Tests can be executed using the following commands:

```bash
# Run all tests
php tests/runAllTests.php

# Run specific test categories
php tests/unit/UserTest.php
php tests/integration/PostCommentsTest.php
php tests/functional/AuthenticationTest.php
```

The test suite uses a mock database implementation to simulate database operations without affecting the production database. Custom assertion methods are provided via the TestHelper class to validate test results.
